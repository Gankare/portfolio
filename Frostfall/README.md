## *A brief game description*  

**Frostfall** Is a single player horror game located in a snowy forest at night. Your car ran out of fuel and with only a lighter, you have to search the woods for fuel.  
A wendigo roams the woods and is not happy to see you, you can run but you can not hide.  
Gather fuel and fill the car upp, when you have a full gass tank you can escape the woods and survive the night.
